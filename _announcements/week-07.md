Please fill out this post-midterm 1 survey: https://forms.gle/xuTr6NUik3VSJTGx7

It should only take 5 minutes and there will be a codeword you need to tell your TA this week to get checked off.

Also, Valmik is out of town until 10/15 so his OH will be cancelled during this time. To make up for this, we are holding a few extra OH with other TAs. Please check Piazza for the extra OH schedule.
