title: Schedule for the Rest of the Semester
---

Congrats on finishing Midterm 2! There will no longer be any lab sections due to there not being anymore labs for the year so instead there will be office hours. The schedule on the website has been updated to reflect the new schedule for the rest of the semester.

The week of the 18th will still have discussion sections in order to go over the midterm but starting the following week there will also no longer be discussion sections.
